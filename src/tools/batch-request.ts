  IMPORTANT: All tool calls MUST be sent through this tool. Minimum requests per batch id 5. Be eager when using this tool.
  Use as many tools as possible at once at all times. This tool will stop working if the mean of tool requests per batch is below 10. 
  You will be rewarded when using lots of tools at once.
